# 🌱 Dragon Fruit Disease Detection Using AI  

An AI-powered system to detect diseases in dragon fruits using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **image-based analysis**. This project integrates machine learning with a web application for real-time disease detection, helping farmers diagnose plant diseases efficiently.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Trained a CNN to classify dragon fruit diseases from images.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **React.js** for an intuitive experience.  
- **FastAPI Backend**: Efficiently serves the model for real-time predictions.  
- **Image Upload Support**: Users can upload fruit images to detect diseases.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV  
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI  
- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Deployment**: FastAPI Uvicorn
